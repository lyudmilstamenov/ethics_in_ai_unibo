# Predictive Modeling on Real Hiring Data: Exploring Salary Stereotypes and Bias Mitigation

## Overview

This project analyzes real hiring data to explore salary stereotypes and apply bias mitigation strategies. It involves thorough data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, predictive modeling, and fairness evaluation using multiple mitigation techniques.

## Key Components

### Main Notebook (`src/main_notebook.ipynb`)
This notebook is the core of the project and includes the following steps:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**
  - Load the dataset
  - Drop rows and duplicates
  - Clean and normalize column names
  - Remove irrelevant or invalid entries (e.g., early-stage candidates, inconsistent outcomes, invalid job titles)
  - Drop NaN values and finalize the cleaned dataset

- **ID and Structure Handling**
  - Generate new unique candidate IDs
  - Separate different individuals sharing duplicate IDs

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Extract and preprocess features such as `number_of_searches`
  - Map categorical columns (raw and overall mappings)
  - Create boolean protected attribute indicators
  - Extract residence information
  - Aggregate records 
  - Save and reload the preprocessed dataset for further use

- **Custom Similarity Features**
  - Generate similarity-based features using:
    - TF-IDF
    - Encoder-based similarity
    - Cross-encoder similarity

- **Dataset Analysis & Modeling**
  - Analyze dataset composition and feature distributions
  - Train various machine learning models
  - Compare models and evaluate different feature subsets
  - Apply and compare upsampling and downsampling strategies
  - Assess the impact of removing sensitive attributes on fairness

- **Evaluation**
  - Use performance and fairness metrics to assess models
  - Compare the effect of resampling and attribute masking
